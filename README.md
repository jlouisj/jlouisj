## Hi there 👋
I'm Jasmine (AKA pushsxpulls).
I'm a QA engineer turned software developer. I've recently started to take a bigger interest in web development. 
I love working on new projects, learning new technologies, and challenging myself :)

If I'm not programming, I'm most likely at the gym, reading a book, or taking a nap. 
So a lot of my starting projects will most likely involve those things.

currently working on:
building a portfolio site to display projects

currently learning:
p5.js
